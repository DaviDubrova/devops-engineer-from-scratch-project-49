# Brain Games -->
This repository contains simple command-line games written in Python as part of the "DevOps Engineer from Scratch" educational project. Each game greets the user and asks a question such as whether a number is even.

## Games in the project -->

- **brain-games**: Greets the user and asks for their name.
- **brain-even**: Asks the user whether a randomly generated number is even.
- **brain-calc**: Asks the user to calculate the expression and write the right answer
